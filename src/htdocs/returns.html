          <h3>Returns</h3>

          <p>Goods can either be returned to store or by post (see below). Please note that we do not offer an exchange service
            by post.</p>
          <p>We reserve the right to refuse to exchange or refund items that are not returned within 28 days of delivery.</p>
          <p>In order to qualify for our refunds policy, all Items must be in a re-saleable condition i.e. undamaged, in their
            original and undamaged packaging, unworn and complete with all tags and labels attached.</p>
          <p>We reserve the right to refuse to refund items that are returned that are not in re-saleable condition. Goods returned
            in an unsatisfactory and not in a re-saleable condition may be returned to you at your expense.</p>
          <p>Goods must be returned with your original receipt and be in the condition that they were purchased. Without a receipt
            we will exchange or refund in vouchers at the last known selling price. Unfortunately we are not able to offer
            exchanges or refunds in vouchers for items purchased from any of Matalan's other trading divisions, including
            Sporting Pro stores or their website, without a valid receipt or delivery note. Further exceptions apply, please
            ask instore.</p>
          <p>If you return a single item bought as part of a multi-buy discount offer (for example buy 2 for £20.00) you will
            be refunded the full price of the item less any discount given in the offer. If you return all the items purchased
            with the multi-buy offer discount you will refunded with the full multi-buy value.</p>
          <p>If you return items won during our 30th birthday "win your basket" promotion, you will be refunded the value of
            those items returned in vouchers. Where you received money off the price of your basket, you will first be refunded
            the amounts paid by you, following which any money off amounts shall be refunded in vouchers. If your payment
            card expires before we process your refund please contact customer services by telephone with your order number,
            postcode and new card details.
          </p>
          <p>Our refunds policy is in addition to your statutory rights.</p>

          <h3>Your Consumer Right of Return and Refund</h3>

          <p>If you are a consumer, you have a legal right to cancel a contract under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation
            and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (“Regulations”) during the period set out below. This means that during
            the relevant period if you change your mind or decide for any other reason that you do not want to receive or
            keep goods, you can notify us of your decision to cancel the contract and receive a refund. Advice about your
            legal right to cancel the contract is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards
            office.
          </p>

          <p>However, for reasons of health, hygiene, safety and copyright this cancellation right does not apply in the case
            of:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>pierced earrings, cosmetics, fragrances, hats, hair accessories, quilts, duvets, pillows, DVD’s (in original
              packaging with any security seals still intact), confectionery, underwear (unless the hygiene strips and tags
              are still in place), control wear, hosiery and swimwear (unless the hygiene strips and tags are still in place);
              and</li>
            <li>sealed audio or sealed video recordings or sealed computer software, once these Products are unsealed after you
              receive them; and</li>
            <li>any goods which become mixed inseparably with other items after their delivery.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Your legal right to cancel a contract starts from the date of the Dispatch Confirmation (the date on which we e-mail
            you to confirm our acceptance of your order), which is when the contract between us is formed. Your deadline
            for cancelling the contract then depends on what you have ordered and how it is delivered, as set out in the
            table below:</p>

          <div class="island">
            <h3 class="u-mar-v-0 u-pad-v-medium">Your Contract &amp; Cancelation Period</h3>

              <p><strong>Your contract is for a single product (which is not delivered in instalments on separate days).</strong></p>
              <p>The end date is the end of 14 days after the day on which you receive the goods. Example: if we provide you
                with a Dispatch Confirmation on 1 January and you receive the goods on 10 January you may cancel at any time
                between 1 January and the end of the day on 24 January.</p>

              <p><strong>Your contract is for either of the following: one product which is delivered in instalments on separate days.
                Multiple products which are delivered on separate days.</strong></p>
              <p>The end date is 14 days after the day on which you receive the last instalment of the goods or the last of
                the separate goods ordered. Example: if we provide you with a Dispatch Confirmation on 1 January and you
                receive the first instalment of your goods or the first of your separate goods on 10 January and the last
                instalment or last separate goods on 15 January you may cancel in respect of all instalments and any or all
                of the separate goods at any time between 1 January and the end of the day on 29 January.</p>

              <p><strong>Your contract is for the regular delivery of a product over a set period.</strong></p>
              <p>The end date is 14 days after the day on which you receive the first delivery of the goods. Example: if we
                provide you with a Dispatch Confirmation on 1 January in respect of goods to be delivered at regular intervals
                over a year and you receive the first delivery of your Product on 10 January, you may cancel at any time
                between 1 January and the end of the day on 24 January. 24 January is the last day of the cancellation period
                in respect of all goods to arrive during the year.</p>

          </div>

          <p>To cancel a contract, you just need to let us know that you have decided to cancel. The easiest way to do this
            is to print off and complete the cancellation form on our website. A link to the website cancellation form will
            be included in our Dispatch Confirmation.</p>

          <p>You can also e-mail us at Customer Services at cs@matalanonline.co.uk or contact our Customer Services team by
            telephone on 0333 0044444 or by post to Matalan Customer Services, Perimeter Road, Knowsley Industrial Estate,
            Kirkby, Knowsley, L33 7SZ. If you are e-mailing us or writing to us please include details of your order to help
            us to identify it. If you send us your cancellation notice by e-mail or by post, then your cancellation is effective
            from the date you send us the e-mail or post the letter to us. For example, you will have given us notice in
            time as long as you get your letter into the last post on the last day of the cancellation period or e-mail us
            before midnight on that day.</p>

          <p>If you cancel your contract we will:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Refund you the price you paid for the goods. However, please note we are permitted by law to reduce your refund to reflect
              any reduction in the value of the goods, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would
              not be permitted in a shop. See our Returns page for information about what handling is acceptable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refund any delivery costs you have paid, although, as permitted by law, the maximum refund will be the costs of delivery
              by the least expensive delivery method we offer (provided that this is a common and generally acceptable method).
              For example, if we offer delivery of goods within 3-5 days at one cost but you choose to have the goods delivered
              within 24 hours at a higher cost, then we will only refund what you would have paid for the cheaper delivery
              option.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make any refunds due to you as soon as possible and in any event within the deadlines indicated below:
              <li>
                If you have received the goods and we have not offered to collect it from you: 14 days after the day on which we receive
                the goods back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent
                the goods back to us. For information about how to return goods to us, see provisions set out below;
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have not received the goods or you have received it and we have offered to collect it from you: 14 days after you
                inform us of your decision to cancel the contract.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have returned the goods to us under this consumer right of return and refund pursuant to the Regulations because they
                are faulty or mis-described, we will refund the price of the goods in full, together with any applicable
                delivery charges, and any reasonable costs you incur in returning the item to us.
              </li>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            We will refund you on the credit card or debit card used by you to pay, but in the event of a partial refund we reserve the
            right to issue a cheque to you. If the card you used to pay with expires before the refund is made please call
            us to give us your new card details.
          </p>
          <p>
            If goods have been delivered to you before you decide to cancel your contract:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>You must return it to us without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days after the day on which you
              let us know that you wish to cancel the contract. You can either send it back or return it to us in-store.
              Please note that we do not offer an exchange service by post. Please see our Returns page headed Returns by
              Post for our returns address and how to arrange a return;</li>
            <li>Unless the goods are faulty or not as described (in this case, see above), you will be responsible for the cost
              of returning the goods to us. If the goods cannot be returned by post, we estimate that if you use the carrier
              which delivered the goods to you, these costs should not exceed the sums we charged you for delivery. If we
              have offered to collect the Product from you, we will charge you the direct cost to us of collection from our
              usual carrier.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Statutory Rights</h3>
          <p>Because you are a consumer, we are under a legal duty to supply goods that are in conformity with this contract.
            As a consumer, you have legal rights in relation to the goods that are faulty or not as described. These legal
            rights are not affected by your right of return and refund in this consumer right of return and refund policy
            pursuant to the Regulations or anything else in these Terms. Advice about your legal rights is available from
            your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office.</p>
