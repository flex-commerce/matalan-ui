        You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. George. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Perfect, just perfect. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Ahh. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Doc. Flux capacitor. I have to tell you about the future. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists.
